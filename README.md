## Quick Start üöÄ

### Option 1 ‚Äî Run directly from CodeShare

```
> Replace `v396` with your desired version to test.

### Option 2 ‚Äî Run using a local script
```bat
set "SCRIPT=C:\Users\PCName\Desktop\TheScriptThatYouDownloaded.js"
"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python312\Scripts\frida.exe" -U -f com.instagram.android -l "%SCRIPT%"
